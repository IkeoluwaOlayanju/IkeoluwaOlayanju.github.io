# Analysis on Healthcare Access in Africa
## Overview
This case study aimed to analyze healthcare facility data, identify disparities in access to healthcare between rural and urban regions, and evaluate the efficiency of healthcare funding. The objective was to propose data-driven recommendations that governments and stakeholders can implement to enhance healthcare service delivery across Africa. Data cleaning, analysis and creation of visuals were carried out on powerBI.
## Tools
- Power BI
- Healthcare access dataset sourced from Kaggle
## Key highlights of the dataset
- Rural vs. Urban Healthcare Disparities
- Healthcare Workforce Availability
- Patient Accessibility and Utilization
- Funding and Resource Allocation
- Patient Satisfaction and Healthcare Outcomes
## Process
- The data was imported into power bi and loaded onto power query for cleaning and transformation of the data. 
- Creation of a new column titled ‘Urban_Rural Areas’ 
- Built multiple visualizations and KPIs to show access to healthcare in urban and rural areas
- Designed a user-friendly report page with filters for interactivity
## Insights and Recommendations
* There are more rural areas than urban in Africa which can be a factor contributing to poor access to healthcare
* The government should look into implementing policies that would help develop the rural areas suh as provision of basic amenities like electricity, good roads, etc.
* Proper allocation of funds to help develop the healthcare faciities in these areas
