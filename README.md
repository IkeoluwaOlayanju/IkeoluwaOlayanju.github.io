# COVID-19 Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📊 Overview
This project presents an interactive dashboard analyzing the global impact of COVID-19. Using Power BI, I explored confirmed cases, deaths, recoveries, and healthcare access trends across countries and regions.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI
- Microsoft Excel
- Public COVID-19 datasets (e.g., WHO, Johns Hopkins)

## 🔍 Key Features
- **Global Trends**: Total confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time  
- **Country-Specific Analysis**: Top affected countries and per-country trends  
- **Regional Breakdown**: Cases grouped by WHO regions  
- **Daily Progression**: Visualization of new daily cases, deaths, and recoveries  
- **Healthcare KPIs**: Insights using additional healthcare access data  

## 📌 Process
1. Collected and cleaned global COVID-19 data in Excel
2. Imported data into Power BI and performed necessary transformations
3. Built multiple visualizations and KPIs to track pandemic trends
4. Designed user-friendly report pages with filters and slicers for interactivity

## 📈 Insights
- Certain regions showed spikes that correlated with policy changes or vaccine rollout
- Countries with stronger healthcare access showed quicker recovery rates
- Clear visualization of daily spikes helped in identifying second and third waves
